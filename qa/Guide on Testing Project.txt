Purpose: This document will guide you through setting up a web server in order to test the files in your local repository. You cannot run them individually and must setup a server.

Linux
I’m assuming you know what you’re doing so I won’t make a guide unless it's completely necessary. Any Youtube video should suffice. Basically, you will setup an Apache server and redirect the Document Root to your local repository folder.

Mac/Windows
Step 1:
Go to https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/ and download then install the latest version of MAMP.  

Step 2:
After installing MAMP, run it and go into the settings. Under the Web-Server tab, click on the little folder icon with the dots next to the Document Root option and select the path where your local group2repo folder is setup. In my case, it's in the Downloads folder. Click OK after you’re done.

Step 3:
Run the Apache server in MAMP by clicking the “Start Servers” button. 

Step 4: It should automatically open a webpage upon starting the servers. Click on the “My Website” option in the navigation bar to view the project. If it doesn’t, simply go to http://localhost:8888 to run the website.
