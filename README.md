# Whack-a-Prof
Whack-a-Prof is a game developed by a team of students for 
CISC 3140: Large Scale Web Applications at Brooklyn College in the Spring 2018 semester.

The team was divided into four groups: 
1. Specifications
2. Quality Assurance / Documentation
3. Graphics / Sound
4. Backbone

## Description
The game consists of a playing field with several "blinds" behind which characters hide and reveal themselves.
The player is equipped with a mallet, which they can use to hit the characters when they are revealed.
Hitting or failing to hit characters will add or deduct points from the player's score.
Each game has a duration of 60 seconds, and a countdown timer informs the player of their remaining time.

There are three categories of characters with different point values:
1. Professors (+5 hit, -0 miss)
2. Administrators (+10 hit, -0 miss)
3. Trustees (+20 hit, -10 miss)

Additionally, Trustees explode in a hail of blood and guts when they are hit.
